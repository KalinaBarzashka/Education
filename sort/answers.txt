sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: bubble sort is the fasted algorithm in sorted array of numbers (with bigger amount of numbers), but slowest in reversed and random array of numbers significantly; it uses big O n squared and omega n

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: merge sort is much faster with random and reversed array of numbers; it uses big theta n log n

sort3 uses: selected sort

How do you know?: selected sort is the slowest algorithm in sorted array of numbers (with bigger amount of numbers in the array); Omega of n squared, better at reversed arrays, but not fastest. It uses big o of n squared
